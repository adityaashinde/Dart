## Abstract class

An Abstract class in Dart is defined as those classes which contain one or more than one abstract method (methods without implementation) in them. Whereas, to declare an abstract class we make use of the abstract keyword. So, it must be noted that a class declared abstract may or may not include abstract methods but if it includes an abstract method then it must be an abstract class.
