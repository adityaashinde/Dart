## Polymorphism :

Poly means many and morph means forms.
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on
many forms. As humans, we have the ability to take on many forms.

We can be a student, a teacher, a parent, a friend,
and so on. Similarly, in object-oriented programming,
polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

There are two types of polymorphism that are
1.Function Overloading(Compile-time) and
2.Function Overriding(Run-time)

Dart is a dynamically typed language and
Function overloading requires static types, so
Function Overloading is not supported in Dart.
