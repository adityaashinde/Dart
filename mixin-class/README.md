## Mixin class

A mixin is sort of class that can be "associated" to another class in order to reuse pieces of code without using inheritance.
It requires the with keyword.

Flutter doesn't support multiple inheritance but with the help of mixins, the functionality of multiple inheritances can be acheived.
